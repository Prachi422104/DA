# Task 3 - SQL for Data Analysis

In this project, I created an Ecommerce database using MySQL and performed data analysis using SQL.

## Database Structure
- customers
- products
- orders
- order_items

## SQL Concepts Used
- SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- INNER JOIN
- Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG)
- Subqueries
- Views
- Indexes (Query Optimization)

## Key Insights Generated
- Total Revenue
- Revenue by Category
- Top Customers
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Customers spending above average

This task helped me understand structured data manipulation and relational database analysis.
